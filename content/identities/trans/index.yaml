    Trans/Transgender is a broad label used to describe anyone who isn't def:cis[], which can cover
    binary trans men and women, id:non-binary[] people, and others.

    Not all who identify as non-def:cis[] (such as some id:non-binary[] and id:agender[] people) use the label trans,
    but many do.
