    The aromantic spectrum describes several forms of def:romantic-attraction[name=romantic attraction],
    including having no romantic attraction (id:aromantic[]),
    romantic attraction after forming a bond (id:demiromantic[]), as well as additional labels and def:microlabel[name=microlabels].

    ## Desire

    Attraction, desire, and activity are separate concepts - some find they are aligned on all three categories,
    others have differing stances.

    Aromanticism is traditionally only linked to attraction to others, and doesn't imply anything about desire or activity.

    Desire is traditionally classified as def:romance-repulsed[name=romance repulsed], def:romance-indifferent[name=romance indifferent],
    def:romance-ambivalent[name=romance ambivalent], and def:romance-favorable[name=romance favorable], pertaining to what you personally
    desire irrespective of attraction.

    All of this is also separate from activity.

    ## Aromantic Identities and Labels

    ### Split-Attraction Model

    People on the id:ace-spec[name=asexual] and aromantic spectrums sometimes use the def:sam[name=split attraction model] (SAM)
    to specify differences in their sexual and romantic attractions.
    
    "id:bi[name=Bisexual] id:aromantic[]" would be an example of using the def:sam[name=SAM] to label someone who
    has def:sexual-attraction[name=sexual attractions] but is id:aromantic[] without def:romantic-attraction[name=romantic attraction].

    ### Aroace

    People who are both id:aromantic[] and id:asexual[] may shorten "aromantic asexual" to id:aroace[] (also styled as "aro ace").

    People who are aroace may have def:tertiary-attraction[name=tertiary attraction] (id:oriented-aroace[name=oriented aroace]),
    no tertiary attraction (id:electio-aroace[name=electio aroace]),
    or have sexual, romantic, or tertiary attraction
      while identifying under the id:ace-spec[name=asexual] and aromantic spectrums (id:angled-aroace[name=angled aroace]).

    As with the entire id:ace-spec[name=asexual] and aromantic spectrums, the id:aroace[] label does not directly correlate to
    sexual or romantic desire, and people who identify as aroace can be
    def:sex-repulsed[name=sex repulsed], def:sex-favorable[name=sex favorable],
    def:romance-repulsed[name=romance repulsed], def:romance-favorable[name=romance favorable],
    or anywhere between any of those labels.

    ### Aromantic Spectrum Labels

    Some identify simply as being on the aromantic spectrum, while others use specific labels.
    A non-exhaustive list of labels and def:microlabel[name=microlabels] is included below.

    [horizontal]
    id:aromantic[name=Aromantic]::
      The Aromantic label can refer to the entire aromantic spectrum/used as an umbrella instead of sharing a specific label,
      but also can be used to refer to those without any romantic attraction.
    id:demiromantic[name=Demiromantic]::
      The demiromantic label refers to people who develop romantic attraction only after forming a personal bond.

    This is a non-exhausive list and there are many more labels and identities inside the aromantic spectrum.
