    The asexual spectrum describes several forms of def:sexual-attraction[name=sexual attraction],
    including having no sexual attraction (id:asexual[]),
    sexual attraction after forming a bond (id:demisexual[]), as well as additional labels and def:microlabel[name=microlabels].

    ## Desire

    Attraction, desire, and activity are separate concepts - some find they are aligned on all three categories,
    others have differing stances.

    Asexuality is traditionally only linked to attraction to others, and doesn't imply anything about desire or activity.

    Desire is traditionally classified as def:sex-repulsed[name=sex repulsed], def:sex-indifferent[name=sex indifferent],
    def:sex-ambivalent[name=sex ambivalent], and def:sex-favorable[name=sex favorable], pertaining to what you personally
    desire irrespective of attraction.

    These are different from def:sex-positive[name=sex positive] and def:sex-negative[name=sex negative] -
    which pertain to your political/moral views in general as opposed to your personal desires.

    All of this is also separate from activity, e.g. def:celibacy[].

    ## Asexual Identities and Labels

    ### Split-Attraction Model

    People on the asexual and id:aro-spec[name=aromantic] spectrums sometimes use the def:sam[name=split attraction model] (SAM)
    to specify differences in their sexual and romantic attractions.
    
    "id:bi[name=Biromantic] id:asexual[]" would be an example of using the def:sam[name=SAM] to label someone who
    has def:romantic-attraction[name=romantic attractions] but is id:asexual[] without def:sexual-attraction[name=sexual attraction].

    ### Aroace

    People who are both id:aromantic[] and id:asexual[] may shorten "aromantic asexual" to id:aroace[] (also styled as "aro ace").

    People who are aroace may have def:tertiary-attraction[name=tertiary attraction] (id:oriented-aroace[name=oriented aroace]),
    no tertiary attraction (id:electio-aroace[name=electio aroace]),
    or have sexual, romantic, or tertiary attraction
      while identifying under the asexual and id:aro-spec[name=aromantic] spectrums (id:angled-aroace[name=angled aroace]).

    As with the entire asexual and id:aro-spec[name=aromantic] spectrums, the id:aroace[] label does not directly correlate to
    sexual or romantic desire, and people who identify as aroace can be
    def:sex-repulsed[name=sex repulsed], def:sex-favorable[name=sex favorable],
    def:romance-repulsed[name=romance repulsed], def:romance-favorable[name=romance favorable],
    or anywhere between any of those labels.

    ### Asexual Spectrum Labels

    Some identify simply as being on the asexual spectrum, while others use specific labels.
    A non-exhaustive list of labels and def:microlabel[name=microlabels] is included below.

    [horizontal]
    id:asexual[name=Asexual]::
      The Asexual label can refer to the entire asexual spectrum/used as an umbrella instead of sharing a specific label,
      but also can be used to refer to those without any sexual attraction.
    id:demisexual[name=Demisexual]::
      The demisexual label refers to people who develop sexual attraction only after forming a personal bond.
    id:graysexual[name=Graysexual]::
      Also called gray sexual, grayasexual.
      Refers to people who don't specify their sexual attraction beyond being on the asexual spectrum.
    id:cupiosexual[name=Cupiosexual]::
      People who like/desire a sexual relationship without experiencing sexual attraction.

    This is a non-exhausive list and there are many more labels and identities inside the asexual spectrum.
