    == The LGBTQIA+ Community

    There are many names and acronyms for the community of people who are
    non-def:allo[], non-def:cis[], and/or non-def:hetero[].

    ====
    For brevity and consistency, this resource uses the following language, as defined by the Identities.FYI Styleguide.

    [horizontal]
    Queer:: As the title of this page and in reference to this page
    LGBTQIA+ community:: To refer to the entire community
    LGBTQIA+ identities:: when referring to the specific list of non-def:allo[], non-def:cis[], and/or non-def:hetero[] identities.

    The usage of the two terms is intended to include more of the community than just the listed identities in 'LGBTQIA+',
    mixed with a medium-length acronym that is not a reclaimed slur.

    The primary editor of this website uses multiple labels to define their gender and sexuality, including ones included in 'LGBTQIA+' and ones not,
    as well as identifying with the word queer.
