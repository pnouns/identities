== Development

=== Running Locally

. Clone the repository
. `yarn`

My optimal workflow uses 3 terminals.

One window is split between:

- `yarn workspace @idfyi/website dev` +
  which runs webpack in a watch mode
- An empty terminal that I can run yarn and git commands, and `yarn build` to compile as needed

The second window (which is usually hidden)
runs `yarn serve` to serve the files in `dist/`.

=== Debugging

[source,sh]
